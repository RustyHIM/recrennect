# README

This is an application built on Ruby on Rails from my experiences on Expedition Y (Expeditiony.com). On this outdoor sponsored research trip I learned more about the obstacles preventing Generation Y from being more active outside, especially in regards to wilderness based activities. From those findings on top of my life experiences I have embedded what I think to be a web app solution ultimately getting more people outside, active and involved with social based physical activities.
